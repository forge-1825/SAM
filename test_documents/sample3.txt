Sample Document 3: Data Science Fundamentals

Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract 
insights from data.

Core Components:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Statistical Modeling
4. Machine Learning
5. Data Visualization
6. Communication of Results

Data Collection involves gathering relevant data from various sources including:
- Databases
- APIs
- Web scraping
- Surveys
- Sensors

Data Cleaning is crucial for ensuring data quality:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting inconsistencies
- Standardizing formats

Exploratory Data Analysis helps understand data patterns:
- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Outlier detection

Statistical Modeling provides frameworks for understanding relationships:
- Regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Time series analysis
- Bayesian methods

Machine Learning enables predictive modeling:
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement learning

Data Visualization makes insights accessible:
- Charts and graphs
- Interactive dashboards
- Infographics
- Reports

The data science process is iterative and requires continuous refinement 
based on new data and changing business requirements.
