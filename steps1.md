Improvement Needed: Enhanced memory chunking strategy and better detection of itemized lists or bullet-pointed capabilities.

2. Lack of Bolded/Structured Capabilities for Easy Reuse
For government contractors or SBIR writers, it‚Äôs useful to have outputs with clearly enumerated capability requests. These should be in bullet form, bolded, and tagged (e.g., [Req 1], [Req 2]).

‚û°Ô∏è Improvement Needed: Post-processing step in the response chain that auto-formats lists with structured tags (e.g., Requested Capability [1]: Remote Code Execution).

3. Too Much Speculation in Abstract Interpretation
SAM inferred DCSA involvement where the source document clearly states PEO SOF Warrior as the office, not DCSA.

‚û°Ô∏è Improvement Needed: Stronger grounding in metadata and document headers before summarizing.

4. No Priority Weighting or Highlighting
All capabilities were treated equally. But for users looking to prioritize innovation areas (e.g., ‚Äúalternative access to protected systems‚Äù), it helps to highlight terms with frequency or relevance markers.

‚û°Ô∏è Improvement Needed: Add simple relevance scoring or frequency highlighting of key capability phrases across the document.

üß† Recommendations for SAM Enhancement
Area	Proposed Change	Justification
Chunking + Enrichment	Upgrade chunker to detect lists, bullets, and numbered items and store them as high-priority memory slices	Bullet lists often encode requirements
Confidence Filtering	Implement a ‚ÄúCapability Extractor‚Äù plugin that identifies defense-related capabilities using regex and semantic filters	To support SBIR/proposal writing use cases
Summarization Strategy	Use a 2-pass summarization where key requirements are separated from general narrative	Improve clarity and reuse
Vector Store	Keep using JSON/Numpy for <1k docs; use FAISS/Chroma if embeddings become sparse across PDFs	No change yet needed unless scaling up

‚úçÔ∏è Sample Enhanced Output (Ideal Target)

Objective: Develop capabilities supporting infrastructure protection through cyber-threat emulation.
