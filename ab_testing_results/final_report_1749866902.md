# Phase 3: A/B Testing Final Report
## SAM Active Reasoning Control Validation

**Generated:** 2025-06-13 22:08:22
**Test Results:** 60 total test executions

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of comprehensive A/B testing to validate SAM's Active Reasoning Control system. We tested three configurations:

- **Arm A (Baseline)**: No TPV - Control group
- **Arm B (Monitoring)**: Phase 1 passive monitoring
- **Arm C (Active Control)**: Phase 2 active reasoning control

## Performance Metrics

### Arm A (Baseline)
- **Tests:** 11
- **Avg Latency:** 30908.2ms
- **Avg Tokens:** 644.8
- **Avg Quality:** 3.00/5
- **Error Rate:** 45.0%

### Arm B (Monitoring)
- **Tests:** 20
- **Avg Latency:** 45737.8ms
- **Avg Tokens:** 214.9
- **Avg Quality:** 3.00/5
- **Error Rate:** 0.0%

### Arm C (Active Control)
- **Tests:** 20
- **Avg Latency:** 45383.6ms
- **Avg Tokens:** 332.9
- **Avg Quality:** 3.00/5
- **Error Rate:** 0.0%
- **Intervention Rate:** 90.0%

## Active Control Analysis

**Total Interventions:** 18/20

**Control Decisions:**
- CONTINUE: 2
- HALT: 18

**Halt Reasons:**
- HALT: 18

## Hypothesis Testing Results

### 1. Efficiency Hypothesis
**Result:** ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
**Confidence:** Low

**Evidence:**
- Latency degraded by 46.8%
- Token usage reduced by 48.4% (644.8 ‚Üí 332.9)
- Quality maintained (change: +0.0/5)

### 2. Quality Hypothesis
**Result:** ‚úÖ SUPPORTED
**Confidence:** Medium

**Evidence:**
- Overall quality change minimal: +0.00/5
- Conciseness change minimal: +0.00/5

### 3. User Experience Hypothesis
**Result:** ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
**Confidence:** Low

**Evidence:**
- Slower responses may hurt user experience (46.8% slower)
- Active control provides transparency (90.0% intervention rate)

## Final Recommendation

**Overall Assessment:** MIXED RESULTS - Limited support for hypotheses

**Go/No-Go Decision:** üü° CONDITIONAL GO - Enable with monitoring
