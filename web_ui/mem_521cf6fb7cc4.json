It provides standard contact information, including LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, phone number, email, and a notable Top Secret (TS/SCI) security clearance obtained since November 2007, suggesting a high level of trustworthiness required for sensitive work. The resume outlines his educational background, certifications like CHFI, and extensive professional experience leading an AI-focused company,Forge1825 LLC.\n\nHis experience emphasizes leadership in AI-driven software development, specifically within cybersecurity and research domains. The resume details his oversight of security hardening and forensic auditing in complex mixed Windows and Linux environments, showcasing practical application of his skills. It also references his work on AI-driven software engineering frameworks and his role in designing multi-agent orchestration systems, indicating a focus on leveraging artificial intelligence for security and operational efficiency.\n\nThe provided code snippets offer concrete examples of his technical capabilities. JavaScript code seems to be part of the resume's own formatting or structure. Python code examples, however, illustrate specific technical skills: one snippet relates to security hardening and forensic auditing, reinforcing his hands-on cybersecurity experience, while another snippet describes the development of lightweight, offline-capable SLM agents (likely Security Log Monitor agents) using a modular knowledge distillation pipeline called BlueAgent. This points towards his proficiency in creating specialized AI tools for security monitoring.\n\nWhile the document itself doesn't contain tables or images, the code blocks serve as direct evidence of his technical work and the systems he has designed or contributed to, particularly the modular BlueAgent pipeline for developing SLM agents. The overall narrative of the resume positions him as a cybersecurity professional with a strong technical foundation in Python and AI, combined with leadership experience and a security clearance relevant to handling classified information.\n\nKey Concepts: <think>\n\nContent Types: text, code\nEnrichment Score: 0.63 (medium)\n",
