Blue Cloak knows the Program of Record platforms, its military operators, and understands the CONOPS. Blue Cloak is uniquely qualified to support ARCYBER's Cyber Battle Lab. Contract Name  Air Force Research Lab - Agile Cyber Technology 2 (ACT2) Prime Contractor  Assured Information Security Prime Contract Number FA875018D0001 Period of Performance 4/12/2018 - 4/11/2023 Task Areas Cyber network operations testing, vulnerability research, exploit development, instrumentation development Blue Cloak has developed a centrally managed/failure tolerant system to facilitate operational T&E, cyber exercises, and cyber training events. This system, known as \"Keromatsu\" is Blue Cloak's cyber range orchestration platform for integrating both cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. It includes a common operating picture (UDOP/COP) and allows for situational awareness, event tracking, analytics, and reporting. We provide a full suite of training, documentation, and continual upgrades. Currently, Blue Cloak is working with Army Futures Command integrating Keromatsu. Blue Cloak is routinely involved with target identification, vulnerability research, exploit development and integration into our Cyber Range. We determine specific AOR requirements and fit targets into realistic network environments likely to be encountered during military operations. Blue Cloak's core competencies are supporting test and evaluation (T&E) and designing cyber exercises. We independently verify and validate USG developed products to be evaluated against measure of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP). Contract Name  NASA - Systems and Software Assurance Services (SAS) Prime Contractor  SAIC Prime Contract Number NNG17SA26C Period of Performance 05/11/2017 - 5/10/2022 Task Areas Cyber exercise planning, scenario development, cyber range development, cyber penetration testing and training Blue Cloak employs realistic network environments complete with target space, gray space, virtualizations, simulations, emulated hardware, and physical hardware. Blue Cloak coordinates with USG sponsors and operational staff to understand CONOPS to enhance realism. We support the annual Capture the Spacecraft exercise, a red vs. blue event to teach offensive IOC identification and cyber defense techniques. We develop tools Operational Technology simulators (e.g., power plants) and use cases to demonstrate cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. Contract Name  USG/IC - Cobalt Ribbon Prime Contractor  SAIC Prime Contract Number 21-C-0225 Period of Performance 05/20/2021 - 5/19/2026 Task Areas Vulnerability assessment, network traffic analysis, cyber range development We support a billion-dollar organization's cybersecurity capability. Our job is to assess critical operational technology (OT), analyze results, and provide recommendations and assistance with mitigating security concerns. We are charged with developing new and innovative tools to make assessments more efficient so that project timelines can be shortened, and more secure infrastructure can be deployed. Beyond a typical vulnerability assessment methodology, we create real-world emulated environments for testing products and to provide a 'playground' for training cyber professionals.\n\n\nMetadata:\nparagraph_index: 1\nword_count: 482\nchar_count: 3630",
