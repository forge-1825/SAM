# 🧠 SAM - Synthetic Autonomous Memory

**The World's First AI with Human-Like Conceptual Understanding**

SAM represents a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence, featuring the first implementation of truly human-like memory processing, cognitive synthesis, and autonomous reasoning capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Secure Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python secure_streamlit_app.py
```
Access at: `http://localhost:8502`

### Memory Control Center
```bash
python launch_memory_ui.py
```
Access at: `http://localhost:8501`

## ✨ Revolutionary Features

### 🧠 **Cognitive Memory Core**
- **Advanced Graph Reasoning** with 4 reasoning types (semantic, causal, temporal, analogical)
- **Real-Time Graph Database Integration** with Neo4j/NetworkX support
- **Enhanced Citation & Source Tracking** with 6-factor credibility scoring
- **Performance Optimization Suite** with 50% cache hit rates

### 🎨 **Dream Canvas - Interactive Cognitive Visualization**
- **Clickable Memory Clusters** with detailed exploration
- **Interactive Synthesis Engine** with real-time cluster analysis
- **Cognitive Landscape Mapping** using UMAP projections
- **"So What" Insights** from concept relationships

### 🔒 **Enterprise Security**
- **Application-Layer Encryption** with AES-GCM
- **Argon2 Key Derivation** for maximum security
- **In-Memory Session Keys** with automatic cleanup
- **Multi-User Isolation** with role-based access

### 🌐 **Intelligent Web Integration**
- **Sanitized Airlock Processing** for content decontamination
- **Multi-Engine Search** with intelligent routing
- **Credibility Analysis** with bias detection
- **Real-Time Knowledge Synthesis**
