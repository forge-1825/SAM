## üìà Rollback Procedures

### **Emergency Rollback Plan:**

1. **Immediate Disable** (< 5 minutes)
   ```python
   # Emergency SLP disable
   slp_integration.disable_slp()
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback** (< 15 minutes)
   - Disable pattern capture while maintaining existing programs
   - Reduce confidence thresholds to minimize pattern usage
   - Enable enhanced monitoring and logging

3. **Full Rollback** (< 30 minutes)
   - Complete SLP system shutdown
   - Revert to Phase 2 TPV-only configuration
   - Preserve pattern database for future analysis

### **Rollback Triggers:**
- System availability drops below 95%
