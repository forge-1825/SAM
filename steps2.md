text chunking is one of the most critical factors in improving document QA accuracy, especially for long and complex documents like SBIRs, RFPs, white papers, or PDFs. Below is a breakdown of advanced chunking strategies tailored for SAM, along with implementation guidance your AI Dev can follow.

🔍 Advanced Text Chunking Strategies for Document AI
1. Semantic-Aware Chunking (vs Fixed-Length)
What it is: Chunks are split at logical boundaries (e.g., section headers, bullets, paragraph ends) using semantic cues — not just by token count.

Why: Prevents mid-sentence/context truncation. Enables more meaningful vector embeddings.

Implementation:

Use NLP tools like spaCy or LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with custom separators:

python
Copy
Edit
separators = ["\n\n", "\n", ".", "!", "?", ",", " "]
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(separators=separators, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)
Add rule-based parsing for PDFs using:

Section headers (SECTION X:, Abstract, Conclusion, OBJECTIVE)

Bullet detection (-, •, 1., a.)

Tables and captions

2. Title + Body Chunk Fusion
What it is: When a section title is detected, fuse it with the body that follows to maintain topic continuity.

Why: Prevents title drift during embedding — where the vector knows the content but loses the label (e.g., "OBJECTIVE").

Implementation:

python
Copy
Edit
if line_is_title:
    chunk_title = line
    next_chunk = get_next_paragraph()
    full_chunk = f"{chunk_title}\n{next_chunk}"
3. Hierarchical Chunking (Multi-Level)
What it is: Create chunks at different granularity levels — e.g., document → section → paragraph → sentence — and link them hierarchically.

Why: Enables different zoom levels of recall during retrieval and can improve reasoning.

Implementation:

Store:

doc_id, section_id, paragraph_id, sentence_id, text, parent_id

Optionally store a “summary per section” vector alongside sentence-level chunks

Enables queries like: “Summarize Section 4.2” without retrieving irrelevant paragraphs

4. Table, List, and Bullet-Aware Extraction
What it is: Detect and preserve list or table structure when chunking. Especially important in RFPs and requirement documents.

Why: Lists often contain dense requirement data. Flattening them loses semantics.

Implementation:

Use PDF parsers like pdfplumber, pdfminer.six, or unstructured

Detect:

Tables: if line has >2 tabular alignments

Bullets: starts with -, •, •, a), 1.

Store structured metadata:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "chunk_type": "list_item",
  "list_parent": "Required Capabilities",
  "item_number": "2.b",
  "text": "Bi-directional communications using unpublished methods"
}
5. Overlapping Window Strategy with Semantic Boundary Control
What it is: Adds partial overlap between chunks to preserve context, but also ensures no overlap breaks a sentence or paragraph.

Why: Improves context retention in embeddings and retrieval, especially across paragraph breaks.

Implementation:

Set overlap tokens (chunk_overlap=150)

Use boundary-aware split logic:

python
Copy
Edit
if len(chunk) + len(next_sentence) < max_chunk_size:
    chunk += next_sentence
else:
    chunks.append(chunk)
    chunk = next_sentence
6. Contextual Labeling for Chunk Enrichment
What it is: Add metadata to each chunk like:

Section Name

Source Page

Role (e.g., Abstract, Requirement, Objective)

Enrichment Tags (e.g., “Cyber Capabilities”, “Evaluation Criteria”)

Why: Enhances downstream QA traceability and lets SAM return granular answers with source references.

Implementation:

During chunk creation, tag:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "text": "...",
  "page_number": 14,
  "section": "Section 3.1 – Capabilities",
  "tags": ["cyber capability", "requirement", "SBIR"]
}
7. Prompt-Optimized Chunk Embedding (RAG-Aligned)
What it is: During embedding, prepend or embed a task-specific prefix to each chunk.

Why: Improves retrieval relevance for RAG-style systems and SAM’s domain-specific behavior.

Implementation Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for chunk in chunks:
    embedding_input = f"Instruction: This is a cybersecurity requirement chunk.\nContent: {chunk['text']}"
    embedding_vector = embedder(embedding_input)

🧠 Final Guidance for AI Dev
Your AI Dev should:

Start with LangChain's recursive splitter + rule-based chunking.

Add PDF-aware enhancements (page numbers, list detection, headers).

Structure output as JSON records with clear chunk_id, parent_section, tags, and text.

Store embeddings + chunk metadata for fast retrieval.

Test with both short and long policy PDFs to validate chunk clarity and precision of retrieval.
