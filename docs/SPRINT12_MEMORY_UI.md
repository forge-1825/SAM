# 🧠 Sprint 12: Interactive Memory Control & Visualization

## 🎯 Overview

Sprint 12 delivers a comprehensive interactive memory management system for SAM, enabling users to search, inspect, manage, and visualize long-term memory through intuitive interfaces. This system enhances trust, traceability, and decision-making by providing complete transparency into SAM's memory operations.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Interactive Memory Browser UI
**Purpose**: View and search stored memories via a visual interface

**Features**:
- 🔍 Advanced search with filter options (date, tag, importance, source)
- 📋 Memory preview cards with timestamp, summary, and scores
- 🔍 Expandable view for full context, source files, and tags
- 📊 Status panel showing memory count, storage usage, and per-user isolation
- 🎛️ Real-time filtering and sorting capabilities

**Integration**: Uses SAM's existing vector store (FAISS/Chroma) for efficient search

### 2. Memory Editing & Deletion Tools
**Purpose**: Give users control over what SAM remembers

**Functions**:
- ✏️ Edit memory title, tags, content, and importance scores
- 📌 Mark as "Pin as Priority" or "Do Not Recall"
- 🗑️ Delete individual memories with confirmation dialogs
- ↩️ Undo option for deletions within session
- 📋 Comprehensive audit logging for all memory changes

**Safeguards**:
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Audit trail for all memory modifications
- Session-based undo functionality

### 3. Memory Visualization (Graph View)
**Purpose**: Help users explore connections across memories and reasoning chains

**Implementation**:
- 🕸️ Interactive graph with nodes as memory entries
- 🔗 Edges represent topic similarity, shared tags, and reasoning lineage
- 🎨 Color-coded by confidence, recency, importance, or user labels
- 📊 Multiple layout algorithms (spring, circular, random, shell)
- 🔍 Interactive zoom, pan, and node selection
- 📈 Graph statistics and clustering analysis

**Libraries**: NetworkX for graph construction, Plotly for interactive visualization

### 4. Enhanced Memory Recall Commands
**Purpose**: Allow users to access specific memories during conversations

**Chat Commands**:
- `!recall topic [keyword]` - Recall memories related to specific topics
- `!recall last N` - Recall the last N memories
- `!searchmem [query]` - General memory search
- `!searchmem tag:[tag]` - Search by specific tags
- `!searchmem source:[source]` - Search by memory source
- `!searchmem date:[YYYY-MM-DD]` - Search by creation date
- `!searchmem user:[user_id]` - Search by user ID
- `!searchmem type:[type]` - Search by memory type
- `!memstats` - Show memory statistics
- `!memhelp` - Display command help

**CLI Equivalents**: All commands support `--output json` for automation pipelines

### 5. Role-Based Memory Filtering
**Purpose**: Let collaborative agents operate on filtered memory scopes

**Features**:
- 🎭 Agent-specific memory access based on role permissions
- 🔐 Memory access levels: Public, Role-Specific, Agent-Private, Restricted
- 🏷️ Tag-scoped memory views per agent role
- 🤝 Collaborative memory sharing between authorized roles
- 📊 Role-specific memory statistics and insights

**Benefits**:
- Better agent focus on relevant memories
- Reduced reasoning noise from irrelevant information
- Aligned memory use to specific task roles
- Enhanced security through access controls

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

```
ui/
├── memory_app.py           # Main Streamlit application
├── memory_browser.py       # Memory browsing and search interface
├── memory_editor.py        # Memory editing and deletion tools
├── memory_graph.py         # Graph visualization component

- **Audit System**: Logs all memory operations for transparency

## 🚀 Usage

### Launching the Memory UI

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit plotly networkx pandas

# Launch the interactive UI
python launch_memory_ui.py

# Or run directly with Streamlit
streamlit run ui/memory_app.py
```

### Using Memory Commands

```python
from ui.memory_commands import get_command_processor

processor = get_command_processor()

# Search for AI-related memories
result = processor.process_command("!recall topic artificial intelligence")

# Get recent memories
result = processor.process_command("!recall last 5")

# Search by tag
result = processor.process_command("!searchmem tag:important")
```

### Role-Based Filtering

```python
from ui.role_memory_filter import get_role_filter
from agents.task_router import AgentRole

role_filter = get_role_filter()

# Filter memories for a specific role
context = role_filter.filter_memories_for_role(
    role=AgentRole.PLANNER,
    agent_id="planner_001",
    query="project planning",
    max_results=10
)

# Create role-specific memory
memory_id = role_filter.create_role_specific_memory(
    content="Strategic planning insights",
    memory_type=MemoryType.INSIGHT,
    source="planning_session",
    role=AgentRole.PLANNER,
    agent_id="planner_001"
)
```
