## ❓ **WHY THE SECURITY ANALYSIS ISN'T VISIBLE YET**

### **Current State:**
- ✅ **Quarantined Content**: 4 files awaiting analysis
- ❌ **Vetted Content**: 0 files analyzed
- ❌ **Security Dashboard**: Not available until content is vetted

### **Required Action:**
- **🛡️ Click "Vet All Content"** to analyze quarantined files
- **⏳ Wait for analysis** to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
- **✅ Security dashboard** will appear automatically after vetting

### **Why This Design:**
- **Security analysis requires processing** - can't show results before analysis
- **Real data needed** - dashboard shows actual security metrics from your content
- **Professional workflow** - analysis → results → decisions
