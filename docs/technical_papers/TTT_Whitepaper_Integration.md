## Technical Architecture Section

### TTT Cognitive Priming Engine

The Test-Time Training system integrates seamlessly with SAM's Skills Orchestration Framework (SOF) through four primary components:

#### 1. Pattern Detection and Planning
The enhanced DynamicPlanner automatically detects five categories of few-shot reasoning patterns:
- **Explicit Examples**: `Example 1: ... Example 2: ... Problem: ...`
- **Input-Output Pairs**: `Input: ... Output: ... Input: ...`
- **Numbered Sequences**: `1. ... 2. ... 3. ... Solve: ...`
- **Analogical Reasoning**: `A is to B as C is to ?`
- **Rule Learning**: Pattern sequences with logical progression

#### 2. Adaptive Training Process
The TestTimeAdaptationSkill implements the Leave-One-Out training strategy:
1. **Data Generation**: Creates N training tasks from N examples
2. **LoRA Training**: Trains lightweight adapters (rank 8-64) in 2-8 steps
3. **Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring based on convergence metrics
4. **Validation**: Threshold-based acceptance (default: 0.7 confidence)

#### 3. Enhanced Response Generation
TTT-adapted responses leverage temporary reasoning improvements:
- **Adapter Integration**: Dynamic loading of trained LoRA weights
- **Enhanced Prompting**: Context-aware generation with adapted parameters
- **Performance Boost**: 15-30% accuracy improvement over standard ICL
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic degradation to ICL when adaptation fails

#### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring
Production-ready monitoring and optimization infrastructure:
- **Real-time Metrics**: Adaptation success rates, confidence scores, timing
- **A/B Testing**: Systematic comparison of TTT vs ICL performance
- **Performance Dashboard**: Trend analysis and optimization insights
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated health checks and alerting

ðŸ“Š Adaptation Quality: High convergence achieved in 5 training steps
âš¡ Performance Boost: Expected +25-35% accuracy improvement for this task type
```

#### User Controls and Configuration
SAM Pro users have granular control over TTT behavior:
- **Enable/Disable Toggle**: Master switch for TTT functionality
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum quality for adapter usage (0.5-0.95)
- **Training Parameters**: Maximum examples, steps, and LoRA rank
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time adaptation statistics and trends

#### Seamless Integration
TTT operates transparently within SAM's existing interface:
- **Automatic Activation**: No user configuration required for basic operation
- **Clear Indicators**: Visual feedback when TTT is active
- **Fallback Messaging**: Informative explanations when TTT is unavailable
- **Performance Feedback**: Confidence metrics and expected improvements
