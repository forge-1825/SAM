## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SAM won't start:**
- Check that Ollama is installed: `ollama --version`
- Ensure the model is downloaded: `ollama list`
- Check logs: `tail -f logs/sam.log`

**Can't access the web interface:**
- Verify the port isn't in use: `lsof -i :5001`
- Try a different port in `config/sam_config.json`
- Check firewall settings

**Memory issues:**
- Restart SAM completely
- Clear old memories from the Memory Control Center
- Check available disk space

**Document upload problems:**
- Ensure PDFs are not password-protected
- Check file size (large files may take time to process)
- Verify sufficient disk space

**Encryption/Security issues:**
- **Forgot master password**: No recovery possible - all encrypted data is lost
- **Keystore corrupted**: Delete `security/keystore.json` and restart (loses all data)
- **Permission errors**: Run `chmod 700 security/` and `chmod 600 security/keystore.json`
- **Setup issues**: See [`docs/ENCRYPTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/ENCRYPTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Getting Help
1. **Check the logs**: `logs/sam.log` contains detailed error information
2. **System status**: Visit http://localhost:5001/health
3. **Read the setup guide**: See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
4. **Reset if needed**: Delete `memory_store/` and `config/` to start fresh
