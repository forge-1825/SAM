# 📥 Quarantined Content Display Enhancement

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

The SAM vetting dashboard has been enhanced to display quarantined content that is awaiting security analysis, providing users with complete visibility into web search results before they are vetted and integrated into the knowledge base.

---

## ❌ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem:** Users could see that content was in quarantine (e.g., "4 file(s) in quarantine awaiting vetting") but had no way to view or access this content before vetting.

**Impact:** 
- No visibility into what content was waiting for analysis
- Users couldn't preview web search results before vetting
- Unclear what would be analyzed when clicking "🛡️ Vet All Content"

---

**Features:**
- 📥 **Complete Content Preview** - Shows all quarantined files with detailed information
- 🔍 **Intelligent Content Extraction** - Automatically identifies content type and key information
- 📊 **Rich Metadata Display** - Shows sources, item counts, timestamps, and methods
- 📝 **Content Previews** - Displays article titles, content snippets, and source URLs
- 🔍 **Raw Data Access** - Toggle to view complete JSON data for debugging

### **Enhanced Content Information Display**

- **📁 File Information**: Filename and quarantine timestamp
- **🔍 Source Details**: Origin (Intelligent Web System, RSS, Direct Fetch)
- **📊 Content Metrics**: Number of items, sources, and content type
