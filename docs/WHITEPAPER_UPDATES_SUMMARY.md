# Enhanced chunking with all 7 strategies
from multimodal_processing.enhanced_chunker import EnhancedChunker
chunker = EnhancedChunker(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)

enhanced_chunks = chunker.hierarchical_chunk_text(
    text=document_content,
    source_location="SOCOM254-P005",
    page_number=1
)
```

#### **Capability Extraction with Structured Output:**
```python
# Defense-specific capability extraction
capabilities = extractor.extract_capabilities(text, "SOCOM_doc")
formatted_output = extractor.format_capabilities_for_output(capabilities)
```

#### **Bulk Document Ingestion:**
```python
# Cross-platform bulk ingestion
manager = BulkIngestionManager()
success = manager.add_source(
    path="/Users/username/Documents",  # Generic, cross-platform
    name="Research Papers",
    file_types=["pdf", "txt", "md"],
    enabled=True
