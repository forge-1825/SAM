   - Rate limiting validation
   - Statistics tracking verification

3. ✅ **Goal Stack Tests**
   - Database operations (add, update, retrieve)
   - Priority-based retrieval
   - Deduplication functionality
   - Statistics and maintenance operations

4. ✅ **Motivation Engine Tests**
   - UIF analysis and goal generation
