# Create DataFrame from table data
data = {
    'Product': ['Software Licenses', 'Hardware Sales', 'Professional Services'],
    'Q3_Sales': [3100000, 2200000, 1600000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create professional bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['Product'], df['Q3_Sales'])
plt.title('Q3 Sales Performance by Product Line')
plt.xlabel('Product Line')
plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Display summary statistics
print(f"Total Q3 Sales: ${df['Q3_Sales'].sum():,.2f}")
print(f"Average Sales per Product: ${df['Q3_Sales'].mean():,.2f}")
