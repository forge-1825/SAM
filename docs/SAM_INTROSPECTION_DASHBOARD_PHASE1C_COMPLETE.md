## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Tracing Integration Pattern**
```python
# Standard tracing pattern for all tools
def execute(self, uif: SAM_UIF) -> SAM_UIF:
    trace_id = uif.intermediate_data.get('trace_id')
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Log start event
    self._log_trace_event(trace_id, "start", "info", "Tool execution started")
    
    try:
        # Tool-specific logic with tracing
        result = self._perform_tool_operation()
        
        # Log success events
        self._log_trace_event(trace_id, "data_out", "info", "Tool completed")
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error events
        self._log_trace_event(trace_id, "error", "error", f"Tool failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Lazy Tracing**: Tracing only activates when trace_id is present
- **Minimal Overhead**: Tracing operations designed for <1ms overhead
- **Error Isolation**: Tracing failures never break tool functionality
- **Efficient Logging**: Batch operations and optimized data structures
