Title: SAM: A Self-Refining, Memory-Augmented AI Analyst Framework

Executive Summary
SAM (Small Agent Model) is a lightweight, highly capable AI framework built to operate efficiently in local environments with minimal resource overhead. It is designed to process, understand, and synthesize knowledge from documents while maintaining transparency, traceability, and adaptability. SAM achieves its intelligence and resilience not through brute-force training or size, but through a multi-layered suite of complementary mechanisms that include knowledge distillation, self-evaluation loops, memory ranking, enhanced citation systems with granular metadata tracking, structured prompt libraries, explicit refusal logic, intelligent query routing, and interactive feedback.

**Phase 3 Enhancement (2025):** SAM has been significantly enhanced with Phase 3 features including hybrid search & ranking engines, refactored citation systems with direct metadata access, and an advanced Memory Control Center with real-time filtering and analytics. These enhancements build upon our selective LongBioBench integration while maintaining our superior SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC reasoning framework and advanced confidence calibration systems.

1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are often impractical in resource-constrained or offline environments. SAM addresses this gap by serving as a compact, locally deployable AI analyst that can ingest and reason over domain-specific data with transparency and context awareness.

2. System Architecture Overview

**Model Base:** DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B (Q4_K_M quantization via GGUF), locally served via Ollama

**Chat Interface:** Streamlit UI supporting document upload, enhanced Q&A, summarization, and memory inspection

**Memory Engine:** Vector-augmented memory with hybrid search, quality ranking, and enhanced citation systems

**Phase 3 Enhancements:**
- **Hybrid Search & Ranking Engine:** Multi-strategy search with semantic similarity, recency scoring, and confidence weighting
- **Enhanced Citation System:** Direct metadata access with granular source attribution and transparency scoring
- **Memory Control Center:** Real-time filtering, source analysis, and interactive configuration controls

**Routing Logic:** Intelligent dispatch of queries to appropriate strategies (memory search, summarization, chat)

**Configurable Modes:** Default solo-agent operation with unlockable swarm-based collaboration

3. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

3.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

3.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

3.3 Enhanced Memory Ranking Engine (Phase 3.2.1)

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

3.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata (Phase 3.2.2)

SAM's citation system has been significantly enhanced with LongBioBench-inspired granular source tracking and Phase 3.2.2 refactoring for direct metadata access:

**Granular Source Attribution:** Citations now include precise location information:
- Page numbers and chunk indices
- Paragraph numbers and section titles
- Document position (0.0-1.0 relative location)
- Confidence indicators: ✓ (high), ~ (medium), ? (low confidence)

**Enhanced Citation Formats:** Multiple citation styles supported:
- Academic: (Author, Year, p. X) with detailed source attribution
- Inline: [source: document.pdf:page_5:chunk_2] with metadata
- Confidence-aware: Citations include reliability indicators
- Granular: [page 5, chunk 2, para 3, section 'Results'] ✓ "exact quote"

**Metadata Extraction:** Automatic extraction from:
- Document metadata and content patterns
- Memory chunk source information
- Section headers and structural elements
- Position-based heuristics for precise location tracking

**Phase 3.2.2 Refactoring Enhancements:**
- **Direct Metadata Access:** Eliminated legacy JSON file lookups for improved performance
- **Enhanced Result Handling:** Seamless integration with `RankedMemoryResult` objects
- **Rich Citation Formatting:** Confidence indicators and granular location metadata
- **Backward Compatibility:** Graceful handling of both new and legacy result formats

This enhanced system provides unprecedented transparency and traceability, allowing users to verify information at the most granular level while maintaining our superior confidence scoring and source attribution capabilities.

3.5 Advanced Memory Control Center (Phase 3.2.3)

3.6 Smart Summarization and Topic Modeling

SAM can synthesize long-form content into topic-driven summaries. These summaries are confidence-scored and stored alongside raw memories to provide layered abstraction for complex reasoning tasks.

3.7 Structured Prompt Library System

SAM now features a comprehensive structured prompt library inspired by LongBioBench's organization while maintaining our superior reasoning capabilities:

**Organized Prompt Categories:**
- **Citation Prompts:** Enhanced, academic, confidence-aware, and synthesis templates

3.8 Explicit Refusal Logic with Confidence Calibration

SAM implements sophisticated refusal mechanisms that go beyond simple "I don't know" responses:

**LongBioBench-Inspired Refusal Logic:**
- Explicit refusal phrases: "The answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents"
- Content quality assessment and completeness checking
- Structured refusal responses with helpful context and suggestions

**Enhanced Uncertainty Handling:**
