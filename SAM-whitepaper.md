4. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

4.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

4.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

4.3 Enhanced Memory Ranking Engine (Phase 3.2.1)

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

4.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata (Phase 3.2.2)

  ```
  Cyber Capability: "Instruction: This is a cybersecurity capability requirement chunk.\nContent: "
  Technical Requirement: "Instruction: This is a technical requirement specification chunk.\nContent: "
  SBIR Content: "Instruction: This is SBIR-specific content with innovation focus.\nContent: "
