Title: SAM: A Self-Refining, Memory-Augmented AI Analyst Framework

Executive Summary
SAM (Small Agent Model) is a lightweight, highly capable AI framework built to operate efficiently in local environments with minimal resource overhead. It is designed to process, understand, and synthesize knowledge from documents while maintaining transparency, traceability, and adaptability. SAM achieves its intelligence and resilience not through brute-force training or size, but through a multi-layered suite of complementary mechanisms that include knowledge distillation, self-evaluation loops, memory ranking, enhanced citation systems with granular metadata tracking, structured prompt libraries, explicit refusal logic, intelligent query routing, and interactive feedback.

**Recent Enhancement (2025):** SAM has been enhanced with selective LongBioBench-inspired features, including granular source tracking, structured prompt organization, and explicit refusal mechanisms, while maintaining our superior SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC reasoning framework and advanced confidence calibration systems.

1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are often impractical in resource-constrained or offline environments. SAM addresses this gap by serving as a compact, locally deployable AI analyst that can ingest and reason over domain-specific data with transparency and context awareness.

2. System Architecture Overview

Model Base: DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B (Q4_K_M quantization via GGUF), locally served via Ollama

Chat Interface: Streamlit UI supporting document upload, enhanced Q&A, summarization, and memory inspection

Memory Engine: Vector-augmented memory with semantic search, quality ranking, and source-linked citations

Routing Logic: Intelligent dispatch of queries to appropriate strategies (memory search, summarization, chat)

Configurable Modes: Default solo-agent operation with unlockable swarm-based collaboration

3. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

3.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

3.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

3.3 Memory Ranking Engine

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

3.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata

SAM's citation system has been significantly enhanced with LongBioBench-inspired granular source tracking:

**Granular Source Attribution:** Citations now include precise location information:
- Page numbers and chunk indices
- Paragraph numbers and section titles
- Document position (0.0-1.0 relative location)
- Confidence indicators: ✓ (high), ~ (medium), ? (low confidence)

**Enhanced Citation Formats:** Multiple citation styles supported:
- Academic: (Author, Year, p. X) with detailed source attribution
- Inline: [source: document.pdf:page_5:chunk_2] with metadata
- Confidence-aware: Citations include reliability indicators
- Granular: [page 5, chunk 2, para 3, section 'Results'] ✓ "exact quote"

**Metadata Extraction:** Automatic extraction from:
- Document metadata and content patterns
- Memory chunk source information
- Section headers and structural elements
- Position-based heuristics for precise location tracking

This enhanced system provides unprecedented transparency and traceability, allowing users to verify information at the most granular level while maintaining our superior confidence scoring and source attribution capabilities.

3.5 Smart Summarization and Topic Modeling

SAM can synthesize long-form content into topic-driven summaries. These summaries are confidence-scored and stored alongside raw memories to provide layered abstraction for complex reasoning tasks.

3.6 Structured Prompt Library System

SAM now features a comprehensive structured prompt library inspired by LongBioBench's organization while maintaining our superior reasoning capabilities:

**Organized Prompt Categories:**
- **Citation Prompts:** Enhanced, academic, confidence-aware, and synthesis templates
- **Reasoning Prompts:** Enhanced chain-of-thought, comparative, quantitative, multi-hop, and SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC
- **IDK Refusal Prompts:** Enhanced refusal, confidence-based, SELF-DISCOVER, and graduated refusal
- **Summary Prompts:** Enhanced synthesis, academic, executive, confidence-aware, comparative, and layered

**Prompt Management Features:**
- Type-safe prompt templates with variable validation
- Centralized prompt manager with category registration
- Template inheritance and customization capabilities
- Fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility

**Advantages Over Basic Systems:**
- Maintainable and debuggable prompt organization
- Consistent formatting and variable handling
- Easy extension and modification of prompt strategies
- Integration with our advanced reasoning frameworks

3.7 Explicit Refusal Logic with Confidence Calibration

SAM implements sophisticated refusal mechanisms that go beyond simple "I don't know" responses:

**LongBioBench-Inspired Refusal Logic:**
- Explicit refusal phrases: "The answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents"
- Content quality assessment and completeness checking
- Structured refusal responses with helpful context and suggestions

**Enhanced Uncertainty Handling:**
- Graduated refusal levels based on confidence thresholds
- SELF-DISCOVER framework integration for uncertainty detection
- Rule-based fallback with content quality metrics
- Helpful refusal formatting with available information summary

**Superior to Basic IDK Systems:**
- Confidence-calibrated refusal decisions (not binary)
- Detailed reasoning for refusal with improvement suggestions
- Integration with our advanced SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC framework
- Partial answer capability when some information is available

3.8 Adaptive Query Routing

An internal classifier assesses each user query to determine the best strategy: direct answer, summarization, memory lookup, or hybrid. Enhanced with structured prompts and explicit refusal logic, this maximizes accuracy and reduces hallucination.

3.9 Enhanced Data Enrichment with GPU Acceleration

SAM features advanced data enrichment capabilities with GPU acceleration and domain-specific processing:

**GPU Acceleration Support:**
- Apple Silicon Metal backend with 5.0x estimated speedup
- Automatic GPU detection and configuration
- Memory optimization and mixed precision support
- Batch processing optimization for multiple documents

- Specialized processing pipelines for different document types
- Enhanced metadata extraction for academic papers

**Advanced Processing Features:**
- Intelligent document chunking that preserves structure
- Section-aware processing (Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion)
- Enhanced PDF layout analysis and content extraction
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple documents

3.10 Thought Transparency (Sprint 16)

To promote accountability and clarity, SAM includes a toggleable view of its internal reasoning for each output, helping users and developers understand how a conclusion was reached. Enhanced with structured prompts and confidence indicators for improved transparency.
