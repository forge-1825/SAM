4. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

4.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

4.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

4.3 Enhanced Memory Ranking Engine (Phase 3.2.1)

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

4.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata (Phase 3.2.2)

        """Generate intelligent execution plan based on query analysis."""

        # Check plan cache for efficiency
        if self._config.enable_plan_caching:
            cached_plan = self._check_plan_cache(uif)
            if cached_plan:
                return cached_plan

        # Generate new plan using LLM
        if self._llm_model:
            plan_result = self._generate_llm_plan(uif)
        else:
            plan_result = self._generate_fallback_plan(uif)

        # Cache successful plans
        if plan_result.confidence > 0.5:

The PlanValidationEngine ensures all execution plans are safe, valid, and optimized before execution:

```python
class PlanValidationEngine:
    def validate_plan(self, plan: List[str], uif: SAM_UIF) -> PlanValidationReport:
        """Comprehensive plan validation with optimization."""

        issues = []

        # 1. Skill existence validation
        issues.extend(self._validate_skill_existence(plan))

        # 2. Dependency satisfaction checking
        dependency_issues, dependency_graph = self._validate_dependencies(plan, uif)
        issues.extend(dependency_issues)

        # 3. Circular dependency detection
        issues.extend(self._check_circular_dependencies(dependency_graph))

        # 4. Plan optimization
        optimization_issues, optimized_plan = self._optimize_plan(plan, dependency_graph)
        issues.extend(optimization_issues)

        # 5. Execution time estimation
        execution_estimate = self._estimate_execution_time(optimized_plan)

        return PlanValidationReport(
            is_valid=len([i for i in issues if i.severity == "error"]) == 0,
            issues=issues,
            optimized_plan=optimized_plan,
            execution_estimate=execution_estimate,
            dependency_graph=dependency_graph
        )
```

```python
# Core ImplicitKnowledgeSkill execution
from sam.orchestration.skills.reasoning.implicit_knowledge import ImplicitKnowledgeSkill

skill = ImplicitKnowledgeSkill()
uif = SAM_UIF(input_query="Find connections between renewable energy and electric vehicles")
uif.intermediate_data["explicit_knowledge_chunks"] = [
    "Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells",
    "Electric vehicles use battery packs to store electrical energy",
    "Grid integration allows renewable energy to charge electric vehicles"
]

# Execute implicit knowledge discovery
result = skill.execute(uif)
