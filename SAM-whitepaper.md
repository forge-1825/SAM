4. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

4.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

4.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

4.3 Enhanced Memory Ranking Engine (Phase 3.2.1)

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

4.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata (Phase 3.2.2)

SAM's citation system has been significantly enhanced with LongBioBench-inspired granular source tracking and Phase 3.2.2 refactoring for direct metadata access:

**Granular Source Attribution:** Citations now include precise location information:

- Avoids breaking content mid-sentence or mid-thought for better context

**Strategy 2: Title + Body Chunk Fusion**
- Automatic detection of section headers and titles
- Fuses titles with following body content for topic continuity
- Maintains semantic relationships across traditional boundaries
- Example: "## Cyber Capabilities" + body content = single contextual chunk

**Strategy 3: Hierarchical Chunking (Multi-Level)**
- Document structure analysis: Document → Section → Paragraph → Sentence levels
- Parent-child relationships linking chunks to containing sections
- Multi-level hierarchy with metadata enrichment and section tracking
- Preserves document organization for better retrieval

**Strategy 4: Table, List, and Bullet-Aware Extraction**
- Comprehensive pattern detection for bullets (•, -, *), numbered lists (1., a., i.)
- Hierarchical list structure preservation with indentation tracking
- Table detection and tabular data structure maintenance
- Rich structure metadata for enhanced processing

**Strategy 5: Overlapping Window Strategy**
- Semantic boundary control with configurable overlap (default: 150 characters)
- Context windows adding previous/next context to each chunk
- Enhanced cross-chunk context understanding for better retrieval
- Respects logical content boundaries while providing continuity

**Strategy 6: Contextual Labeling for Chunk Enrichment**
- Rich enrichment tags: cyber_capability, technical_requirement, evaluation_criteria, sbir_specific
- Advanced metadata: 22 metadata fields vs. 6 in original system (3.7x improvement)
- Section classification: Abstract, objective, requirements, capabilities, methodology
- Priority scoring with context awareness and capability detection

**Strategy 7: Prompt-Optimized Chunk Embedding (RAG-Aligned)**
- Task-specific embedding prefixes for different content types
- Content-aware prefix adaptation based on chunk type and enrichment tags
- Optimized for document QA and retrieval tasks
- Example prefixes:
  ```
  Cyber Capability: "Instruction: This is a cybersecurity capability requirement chunk.\nContent: "
  Technical Requirement: "Instruction: This is a technical requirement specification chunk.\nContent: "
  SBIR Content: "Instruction: This is SBIR-specific content with innovation focus.\nContent: "
  ```
