Title: SAM: A Self-Refining, Memory-Augmented AI Analyst Framework

Executive Summary
SAM (Small Agent Model) is a lightweight, highly capable AI framework built to operate efficiently in local environments with minimal resource overhead. It is designed to process, understand, and synthesize knowledge from documents while maintaining transparency, traceability, and adaptability. SAM achieves its intelligence and resilience not through brute-force training or size, but through a multi-layered suite of complementary mechanisms that include knowledge distillation, self-evaluation loops, memory ranking, enhanced citation systems with granular metadata tracking, structured prompt libraries, explicit refusal logic, intelligent query routing, and interactive feedback.

**Phase 3 Enhancement (2025):** SAM has been significantly enhanced with Phase 3 features including hybrid search & ranking engines, refactored citation systems with direct metadata access, and an advanced Memory Control Center with real-time filtering and analytics. These enhancements build upon our selective LongBioBench integration while maintaining our superior SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC reasoning framework and advanced confidence calibration systems.

**Advanced Memory Chunking Enhancement (June 2025):** SAM's memory system has been revolutionized with advanced chunking strategies implementing all 7 strategies from our research roadmap, including semantic-aware chunking, title+body fusion, hierarchical multi-level chunking, overlapping window strategies, and prompt-optimized embeddings. These enhancements significantly improve document QA accuracy and context preservation for government contractors, SBIR writers, and technical users.

1. Introduction

**Routing Logic:** Intelligent dispatch of queries to appropriate strategies (memory search, summarization, chat)

**Configurable Modes:** Default solo-agent operation with unlockable swarm-based collaboration

3. Enhancement Mechanisms
SAM achieves state-of-the-art reasoning and error resilience for a compact model through the following mechanisms:

3.1 Knowledge Distillation

SAM is trained using teacher-student pipelines where high-capacity LLMs serve as teachers. This process compresses deep domain knowledge into a smaller student model without losing essential semantic structures or reasoning capabilities.

3.2 SELF-DISCOVER + CRITIC Framework

A dual-agent feedback loop allows the student model to identify its knowledge gaps (SELF-DISCOVER) and then challenge its own conclusions or those generated by others (CRITIC). This iterative process leads to:

Self-correction

Identification of weak assumptions

Improved confidence calibration

3.3 Enhanced Memory Ranking Engine (Phase 3.2.1)

All knowledge stored in SAM’s memory is ranked using multi-factor criteria:

Semantic similarity to query

Recency and frequency of reference

User priority and pinning

Confidence of source
This ranking system ensures that the most relevant and trustworthy data is prioritized during context assembly.

3.4 Enhanced Citation System with Granular Metadata (Phase 3.2.2)

SAM's citation system has been significantly enhanced with LongBioBench-inspired granular source tracking and Phase 3.2.2 refactoring for direct metadata access:

**Granular Source Attribution:** Citations now include precise location information:
- Page numbers and chunk indices
- Paragraph numbers and section titles
- Document position (0.0-1.0 relative location)
- Confidence indicators: ✓ (high), ~ (medium), ? (low confidence)

**Enhanced Citation Formats:** Multiple citation styles supported:
- Academic: (Author, Year, p. X) with detailed source attribution
- Inline: [source: document.pdf:page_5:chunk_2] with metadata
- Confidence-aware: Citations include reliability indicators
- Granular: [page 5, chunk 2, para 3, section 'Results'] ✓ "exact quote"

**Metadata Extraction:** Automatic extraction from:
- Document metadata and content patterns
- Memory chunk source information
- Section headers and structural elements
- Position-based heuristics for precise location tracking

**Phase 3.2.2 Refactoring Enhancements:**
- **Direct Metadata Access:** Eliminated legacy JSON file lookups for improved performance
- **Enhanced Result Handling:** Seamless integration with `RankedMemoryResult` objects
- **Rich Citation Formatting:** Confidence indicators and granular location metadata
- **Backward Compatibility:** Graceful handling of both new and legacy result formats

This enhanced system provides unprecedented transparency and traceability, allowing users to verify information at the most granular level while maintaining our superior confidence scoring and source attribution capabilities.

3.10 Advanced Memory Chunking System (June 2025)

SAM features a revolutionary memory chunking system implementing all 7 advanced strategies for improved document QA accuracy and context preservation:

**Strategy 1: Semantic-Aware Chunking**
- Logical boundary respect using recursive separators (\n\n → \n → . → , → space)

**Strategy 3: Hierarchical Chunking (Multi-Level)**
- Document structure analysis: Document → Section → Paragraph → Sentence levels
- Parent-child relationships linking chunks to containing sections
- Multi-level hierarchy with metadata enrichment and section tracking
- Preserves document organization for better retrieval
